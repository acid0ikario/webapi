# MyProject

## Overview

MyProject is a multi-layered application designed to follow best practices in software architecture. The project is divided into several layers, each with a specific responsibility. This separation of concerns helps in maintaining, scaling, and testing the application efficiently.

## Project Structure

The solution is organized into the following projects:

- `MyProject.Api`
- `MyProject.Application`
- `MyProject.Domain`
- `MyProject.Infrastructure`
- `MyProject.Tests`

### MyProject.Api

**Path:** `src/MyProject.Api`

**Purpose:** This project serves as the entry point for the application. It is responsible for handling HTTP requests, routing, and returning HTTP responses. It exposes the application's functionality through RESTful APIs.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Define API endpoints.
- Handle HTTP requests and responses.
- Perform input validation.
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes and data.

### MyProject.Application

**Path:** `src/MyProject.Application`

**Purpose:** This project contains the business logic of the application. It acts as a mediator between the API and the Domain layer, ensuring that business rules are enforced.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Implement use cases and application services.
- Coordinate data flow between the API and Domain layers.
- Ensure business rules are applied correctly.

### MyProject.Domain

**Path:** `src/MyProject.Domain`

**Purpose:** This project represents the core of the application. It contains the domain entities, value objects, and domain services. The Domain layer is independent of any other layers and does not depend on any external libraries.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Define domain entities and value objects.
- Implement domain services and business rules.
- Ensure the integrity of the domain model.

### MyProject.Infrastructure

**Path:** `src/MyProject.Infrastructure`

**Purpose:** This project provides implementations for data access, external services, and other infrastructure concerns. It bridges the gap between the Domain layer and external systems like databases, file systems, and third-party services.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Implement data access repositories.
- Integrate with external services and APIs.
- Handle infrastructure concerns like logging and caching.

### MyProject.Tests

**Path:** `MyProject.Tests`

**Purpose:** This project contains unit tests and integration tests for the application. It ensures that the application behaves as expected and helps in maintaining code quality.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Write unit tests for individual components.
- Write integration tests to verify the interaction between components.
- Ensure code coverage and quality.
